What is Page Object Model in Selenium?
	Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It is useful in 
reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
	
	In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements. Using 
these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.

Steps To Be Follow:
	Step 1: Create a class for each web page
	Step 2: Add object locators
	Step 3: Create class for test
	Step 4: Refer objects from page classes
	Step 5: Run and validate

Benefits of POM
	Test Objects and Functions are separated for easy maintenance and keeping the code clean
	Objects are kept separated from test scripts and can be used multiple times in multiple tests
	Every unique object locator is created only once
	Easy Maintenance and Less Rework
