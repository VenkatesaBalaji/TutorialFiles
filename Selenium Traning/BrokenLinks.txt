What are broken links on a Web page?
	A broken link, often called a dead link, is any link on a web page that no longer works because there is an underlying issue with the link

What are broken images on a Web Page?
	There are cases where an image on the web page does not load properly, and we see “Failed to load image” or similar error messages. In such cases, the image 
is either corrupt or the image is not at the specified path. A broken image on a web page is a link that is associated with the image, and the link is not working.

An URL will always have a status with 2xx which is valid. There are different HTTP status codes which are having different purposes. For an invalid request, HTTP 
status is 4xx and 5xx.

What are HTTP Status Codes?
	A server generates HTTP Status codes in response to the request submitted by the client to the server. There are five types of responses to which we can 
segregate HTTP  response status codes.

		200 – Valid Link/success
		301/302 – Page redirection temporary/permanent
		404 – Page not found
		400 – Bad request
		401 – Unauthorized
		500 – Internal Server Error
We will be using these HTTP codes in our tests to ensure that the link is valid or not.

For checking the broken links, you will need to do the following steps.
	- Collect all the links in the web page based on <a> tag.
	- Send HTTP request for the link and read HTTP response code.
	- Find out whether the link is valid or broken based on HTTP response code.
	- Repeat this for all the links captured.
